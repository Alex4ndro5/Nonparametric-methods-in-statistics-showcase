## Introduction

Nonparametric methods are essential tools in statistics for analyzing data when certain distributional assumptions are not met. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of nonparametric methods and how to implement them using Python. Each notebook in the collection focuses on a specific nonparametric method and provides code examples, explanations, and demonstrations.

## Notebooks

Explore the collection of Jupyter Notebooks, each dedicated to a specific nonparametric method.
Each notebook includes explanations, code samples, and interactive elements to help you learn and apply nonparametric methods effectively.

## Sample Code

Here's a sample code snippet from one of the notebooks, showcasing a simulation of the t-distribution with different degrees of freedom and power calculations for nonparametric tests:

```python
# Symulacja rozk≈Çadu normalnego
def simulate_powers(n_samples, df_values):
    powers = []
    n_tests = 3

    for df in df_values:
        df_powers = np.zeros((n_tests, len(n_samples)))

        for i, n in enumerate(n_samples):
            data = stats.t.rvs(df, size=n)
            norm = stats.norm.rvs(size=n)
            data = (data - np.mean(data)) / np.std(data, ddof=1)

            # Test Shapiro-Wilka
            _, sw_pval = stats.shapiro(data)
            sw_power = 1 - sw_pval
            df_powers[0, i] = sw_power

            # Test Kolmogorov-Smirnova
            _, ks_pval = stats.kstest(data, 'norm')
            ks_power = 1 - ks_pval
            df_powers[1, i] = ks_power

            # Test Chi-squared 
            hist, _ = np.histogram(data, bins='auto')
            _, chi_pval = stats.chisquare(hist)
            chi_power = 1 - chi_pval
            df_powers[2, i] = chi_power

        powers.append(df_powers)

    return powers

np.random.seed(seed=411052)
n_samples = np.arange(5, 200, 3)
df_values = np.array([3, 5, 10, 50, 100])

powers = simulate_powers(n_samples, df_values)
```
